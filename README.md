# Text-Relevance-Classification
This project deploys machine learning to predict relevant text based on the user's search query

The goal is to correctly classify the relevance of a news article given the information needed.

The data set consists of a newspaper article (doc_id, author, body, byline, title) and a description of what a person was looking for (i.e. their information need (see fields topic_id, description, narrative and topic_title)

The objective is to predict whether the article is relevant to the user's information needs.

Predict the Judgement: 0 is not relevant, 1 is relevant.

The performance of the machine learning implementation is measured by the accuracy score
